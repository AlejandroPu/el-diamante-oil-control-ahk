# El Diamante – Oil Control (AutoHotkey)

This repository contains two **AutoHotkey** scripts.

**Principal2014.ahk** is a script I began developing before 2014 for various tasks, such as opening frequently used files.

Part of its code launches another AutoHotkey script that I used during my work at **Transportes El Diamante**.  
It includes my first automation attempts, which helped me save significant time in repetitive tasks.

Later, I developed a VBA project that you can check out here for a more detailed description of the overall workflow:

These scripts have now become obsolete due to updates in both **AutoHotkey** and **Windows**, particularly because the version of **Notepad** I used to execute the scripts has changed.
